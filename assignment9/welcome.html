					Welcome to the Video Games Database.
				</p>
				<p>
					There's a lot to know about a game. Who made it, who marketed it, what languages it's available in, what genres does it fall under, on which platforms is it available and more. If you need some quick information about your favorite games, try the "Search for a game" page to find what you're looking for.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're curious about the companies that make these games possible, use the "Search for a company" page to discover basic information about developers and publishers in the gaming industry.
